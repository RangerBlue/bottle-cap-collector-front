            Welcome to <i>Bottle Cap Collector!</i> The page you are seeing now is written in React. Below you can 
            find a diagram that shows the structure of the system and its components, with relations between them. 
            In the Mobile section, you can see a demonstration of the Android mobile application. The API section 
            contains information about backend created in Spring Boot. The Catalog presents all caps, which I have 
            collected so far, you can filter them out or click on the one you are interested in to see more details. 
            In the footer, you can find a link to the GitHub repository of the application. The system was created 
            to fulfill personal needs â€“ to maintain a big collection of bottle caps and to be a playground for 
            learning new technologies and obtaining certification.
            <br></br>

            At this moment the collection contains <b>{totalAmount}</b> bottle caps.
